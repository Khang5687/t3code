# Claude

T3 Code uses Claude Code's login and configuration. Start with the default provider
for one account; [provider setup](./install.md#providers) covers installation and
shared provider settings.

## Separate accounts or configurations

Use a separate Claude config directory for each account. This also works for named
presets that need different Claude settings or a router connection.

Keep your existing account in the default directory. On the environment's machine,
create the second login:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude_personal
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude_personal claude auth login
```

Add another Claude instance in **Settings > Providers**:

| Instance        | Binary path | CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR path |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Claude Work     | `claude`    | Leave empty            |
| Claude Personal | `claude`    | `~/.claude_personal`   |

An empty config-directory setting uses Claude Code's normal configuration. The
custom setting changes `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, leaving `HOME` and the system keychain
location intact. Use the same variable for the login command. Setting `HOME`
instead can put credentials where this provider will not find them.

Check the account reported in provider settings after signing in. Existing
threads can switch only between Claude instances with the same config directory.
Separate account directories stay isolated, including their local conversation
state. Claude does not have Codex's shared-home and shadow-home arrangement.

For presets that differ only in API keys or endpoints, use the instance's
**Environment variables**. Variable assignments do not belong in **Launch arguments**.

Claude Code's verbose mode can stay enabled when you use Claude for text generation, including
thread titles, branch names, commit messages, and pull request descriptions. On a remote connection,
T3 Code uses the Claude configuration on the connected server.

## Compact long conversations

Set **Auto-compact after** in the Claude provider settings to an integer between
`100000` and `1000000`. For example, `300000` asks Claude to summarize at about
300,000 tokens. This changes when compaction happens, not the model's context
window. Leave it empty for Claude Code's default.

You can also send `/compact` in an existing conversation. Web and desktop offer
**Compact context** from the context meter and may suggest it when you return to
a large older thread. See [commands and skills](./composer.md#commands-and-skills)
for using composer commands.

## Usage limits

If your Claude subscription runs out of usage mid-turn, the thread shows which
limit was reached and the remaining wait when Claude provides a reset time.
Claude Code holds the turn until that window reopens, so it can keep showing as
working. Wait for the reset, or stop the turn and continue later. The warning's
timestamp shows when the displayed wait started.

## Skills

Claude skills come from the config directory's `skills` folder and the project's
`.claude/skills` folder. If both define the same name, the config-directory copy
wins. Skills disabled in Claude's settings do not appear in the composer.

Use `$` in the composer to select a skill. Skills marked `disable-model-invocation`
can still be started by you. Invoke those one per message: Claude directly runs
only the last named skill and may try to start earlier ones through its Skill
tool, which refuses skills reserved for manual invocation.

## OpenRouter

Create a Claude instance with its own config directory, such as
`~/.claude_openrouter`, and keep **Binary path** set to `claude`. In that instance's
**Environment variables**, use:

| Variable               | Value                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`   | `https://openrouter.ai/api`               |
| `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` | Your OpenRouter API key, marked Sensitive |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`    | An explicitly empty value                 |

If that Claude config directory has a cached Anthropic login, run `/logout` in a
Claude Code session using that directory before starting the router setup. Cached
login credentials can conflict with the router token.

Select the model you want in T3 Code. For an OpenRouter model outside the built-in
list, open that Claude instance in **Settings > Providers** and add its full model
ID with **Add custom model**. Then select it in the chat model picker.
`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL` variables map Claude Code aliases such as `sonnet`; they
do not replace the explicit model ID selected in T3 Code. Custom models may have
fewer effort, thinking, or context controls than built-in models.

Verify the model used in OpenRouter's activity dashboard. For current compatibility
requirements, use the
[OpenRouter Claude Code guide](https://openrouter.ai/docs/cookbook/coding-agents/claude-code-integration).

## Other routers

A local router uses an ordinary Claude provider instance. Give it a separate
config directory and put the router's endpoint and credential variables in that
instance's **Environment variables**. The router must run where the environment
can reach it. Follow the [Claude Code Router instructions](https://github.com/musistudio/claude-code-router)
for its installation and routing configuration.

## Cut input tokens with pxpipe

An instance can send its Anthropic traffic through a local pxpipe proxy, which
compresses each request. See [pxpipe sidecar](./pxpipe-sidecar.md) for what to
turn on and what a routed instance gives up.

## Keep claude.ai out of this machine

Claude Code can register a session with claude.ai so it can be driven from the
web, and it auto-loads the connectors your Claude account has. Anyone who shares
that account gets both. T3 Code turns them off for the instances it launches.

**Allow Claude's first-party remote features** on a Claude instance is off by
default and covers, when off:

- Threads, text generation and the provider probes refuse Remote Control and
  claude.ai connectors.
- Terminals opened on that instance refuse claude.ai connectors.

A `claude` you start by hand in a terminal still offers Remote Control, because
Claude Code has no environment variable for it. Set `"disableRemoteControl":
true` in your own Claude settings to close that too, or route the instance
through pxpipe, which stops Claude Code treating the session as first-party at
all.

If the environment's machine is managed by an IT department, the instance says
so: Claude Code ignores the policy T3 Code sends whenever a managed settings
file is installed, so Remote Control stays available there. Connectors are still
off. Ask whoever manages the machine to set `disableRemoteControl` in the
managed settings, or route the instance through pxpipe.

Turn the switch on if you want `/remote-control` and claude.ai connectors back.
It has no effect while the instance routes through pxpipe.
